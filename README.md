This is a WebAPI Project based on Canteen Web API. I here used Code First approach and Minimal WebAPI to create all the tables that are 
ITEM, SUPPLY, PURCHASEITEM, ITEMSTOCK, ITEMUNIT, FOODMENU, FOODMAPPING, KITCHENSTOCK, SALESCUSTOMER
Its code first so you can uodate the tables and their respective DTO's and then update the database through Migration
The connection string is in APPSETTINGS.JSON file. You can change it there
I also use AUTO MAPPER Package to save sometime writing mapping codes.
And as i use MINIMAL API so all the models and controllers codes are stored in the PROGRAM.cs File
You can use this API in many places like HOSPITAL, CANTEEN, OFFICE etc.
THANKS FOR VISITING
PLS STAR THE REPOSITORY
